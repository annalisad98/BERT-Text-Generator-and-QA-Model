# MLDL2021

BERT is one of the most efficient language representa-tion models introduced in last years. Its transformer-basedarchitecture permits to create state-of-art models for a widerange of tasks by easily fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT.Conceptually simple and powerful, BERT is the strong ba-sis for solving many tasks, especially the question answer-ing one included in the functioning of search engines. Fur-thermore, proving it as a Markov Random Field LanguageModel is useful to consider BERT as a high-quality, fluenttext generator too. In this work, first its structure is analyzedand its results as a text generator are compared to other ex-isting models. Finally the power of BERT is extended in thespecific field of question answering task.

# Basic Usage

The [main script](https://github.com/annalisad98/MLDL2021/blob/main/MLDLproject.ipynb) is a workable replica from [BERT has a Mouth, and It Must Speak](https://github.com/nyu-dl/bert-gen), where BERT as a text generator is compared with [OpeanAi GPT](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-openai-transformer-lm/tree/d848a49f718b75287e1bd0364803c41c6b1deef5), [Transfomer-XL](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/src/transformers/models/transfo_xl) and [XL-Net](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/src/transformers/models/xlnet). The evaluation is made using both the metrics from [BERT has a Mouth, and It Must Speak](https://github.com/nyu-dl/bert-gen) and the metrics from the [Texygen platform](https://github.com/geek-ai/Texygen).
In order to run the code, it is necessary to upload some files:
Markup : - Bullet list
              - Nested bullet
                  - Sub-nested bullet etc
          - Bullet list item 
          
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b


Wiki1000sample:
It is a script used to randomly select 1000 phrases from the WikiText-103 dataset. 
At first the titles conteinded in the dataset are discarded, leaving only the phrases. Then the 1000
